# Correlation of the Happiness Index with Homicide Rates

The world happiness index already incorporates data from many categories into its rankings. 
We were interested in how a data category not already incorporated into the rankings compared to the happiness score. The homicide rates seemed like an appropriate variable that fit this criteria. 
The initial thought is that a country with a higher happiness score would have a lower homicide rate, but does this expected relationship hold up?
